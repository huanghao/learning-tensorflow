Images consist of millions of pixels, but there is likely a more compact representation of the content (objects, positions, etc)
Finding the mapping to this representation allows us to find semantically similar images and even to generate new images
We call the compact representation z and its corresponding pixels x, and this is the same structure for every of our N images
