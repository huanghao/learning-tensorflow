    "3 FASTER R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Our object detection system, called Faster R-CNN, is composed of two modules. The first module is a deep fully convolutional network that proposes regions, and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector [2] that uses the proposed regions. The entire system is a single, unified network for object detection (Figure 2). Using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with ‘attention’ [31] mechanisms, the RPN module tells the Fast R-CNN module where to look. In Section 3.1 we introduce the designs and properties of the network for region proposal. In Section 3.2 we develop algorithms for training both modules with features shared.\n",

    "A Region Proposal Network (RPN) takes an image (of any size) as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals, each with an objectness score.3 We model this process with a fully convolutional network [7], which we describe in this section. Because our ultimate goal is to share computation with a Fast R-CNN object detection network [2], we assume that both nets share a common set of convolutional layers. In our experiments, we investigate the Zeiler and Fergus model [32] (ZF), which has 5 shareable convolutional layers and the Simonyan and Zisserman model [3] (VGG-16), which has 13 shareable convolutional layers.\n",

    "To generate region proposals, we slide a small network over the convolutional feature map output by the last shared convolutional layer. This small network takes as input an n × n spatial window of the input convolutional feature map. Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional feature (256-d for ZF and 512-d for VGG, with ReLU [33] following). This feature is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers—a box-regression layer (reg) and a box-classification layer (cls). We use n = 3 in this paper, noting that the effective receptive field on the input image is large (171 and 228 pixels for ZF and VGG, respectively). This mini-network is illustrated at a single position in Figure 3 (left). Note that because the mini-network operates in a sliding-window fashion, the fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. This architecture is naturally implemented with an n×n convolutional layer followed by two sibling 1 × 1 convolutional layers (for reg and cls, respectively).\n",

    "At each sliding-window location, we simultaneously predict multiple region proposals, where the number of maximum possible proposals for each location is denoted as k. So the reg layer has 4k outputs encoding the coordinates of k boxes, and the cls layer outputs 2k scores that estimate probability of object or not object for each proposal4. The k proposals are parameterized relative to k reference boxes, which we call anchors. An anchor is centered at the sliding window in question, and is associated with a scale and aspect ratio (Figure 3, left). By default we use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yielding k = 9 anchors at each sliding position. For a convolutional feature map of a size W × H (typically ∼2,400), there are W H k anchors in total.\n",

    "Translation-Invariant Anchors\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of our approach is that it is translation invariant, both in terms of the anchors and the functions that compute proposals relative to the anchors. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate and the same function should be able to predict the proposal in either lo- cation. This translation-invariant property is guaran- teed by our method5. As a comparison, the MultiBox method [27] uses k-means to generate 800 anchors, which are not translation invariant. So MultiBox does not guarantee that the same proposal is generated if an object is translated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The translation-invariant property also reduces the model size. MultiBox has a (4 + 1) × 800-dimensional fully-connected output layer, whereas our method has a (4 + 2) × 9-dimensional convolutional output layer in the case of k = 9 anchors. As a result, our output layer has 2.8 × 104 parameters (512 × (4 + 2) × 9 for VGG-16), two orders of magnitude fewer than MultiBox’s output layer that has 6.1 × 106 parameters (1536 × (4 + 1) × 800 for GoogleNet [34] in MultiBox [27]). If considering the feature projection layers, our proposal layers still have an order of magnitude fewer parameters than MultiBox6. We expect our method to have less risk of overfitting on small datasets, like PASCAL VOC.\n",

    "Multi-Scale Anchors as Regression References\n",
    "Our design of anchors presents a novel scheme for addressing multiple scales (and aspect ratios). As shown in Figure 1, there have been two popular ways for multi-scale predictions. The first way is based on image/feature pyramids, e.g., in DPM [8] and CNN- based methods [9], [1], [2]. The images are resized at multiple scales, and feature maps (HOG [8] or deep convolutional features [9], [1], [2]) are computed for each scale (Figure 1(a)). This way is often useful but is time-consuming. The second way is to use sliding windows of multiple scales (and/or aspect ratios) on the feature maps. For example, in DPM [8], models of different aspect ratios are trained separately using different filter sizes (such as 5×7 and 7×5). If this way is used to address multiple scales, it can be thought of as a “pyramid of filters” (Figure 1(b)). The second way is usually adopted jointly with the first way [8].\n",
    "As a comparison, our anchor-based method is built on a pyramid of anchors, which is more cost-efficient. Our method classifies and regresses bounding boxes with reference to anchor boxes of multiple scales and aspect ratios. It only relies on images and feature maps of a single scale, and uses filters (sliding win- dows on the feature map) of a single size. We show by experiments the effects of this scheme for addressing multiple scales and sizes (Table 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this multi-scale design based on anchors, we can simply use the convolutional features com- puted on a single-scale image, as is also done by the Fast R-CNN detector [2]. The design of multi- scale anchors is a key component for sharing features without extra cost for addressing scales.\n"

    "3.1.2 Loss Function\n",
    "For training RPNs, we assign a binary class label (of being an object or not) to each anchor. We as- sign a positive label to two kinds of anchors: (i) the anchor/anchors with the highest Intersection-over- Union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box, or (ii) an anchor that has an IoU overlap higher than 0.7 with any ground-truth box. Note that a single ground-truth box may assign positive labels to multiple anchors. Usually the second condition is sufficient to determine the positive samples; but we still adopt the first condition for the reason that in some rare cases the second condition may find no positive sample. We assign a negative label to a non-positive anchor if its IoU ratio is lower than 0.3 for all ground-truth boxes. Anchors that are neither positive nor negative do not contribute to the training objective.\n",
    "With these definitions, we minimize an objective function following the multi-task loss in Fast R-CNN [2]. Our loss function for an image is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "L({pi}, {ti}) =   Lcls (pi, p∗i )\n",

    "5\n",
    "  Nreg i\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, i is the index of an anchor in a mini-batch and pi is the predicted probability of anchor i being an object. The ground-truth label p∗i is 1 if the anchor is positive, and is 0 if the anchor is negative. ti is a vector representing the 4 parameterized coordinates of the predicted bounding box, and t∗i is that of the ground-truth box associated with a positive anchor. The classification loss Lcls is log loss over two classes (object vs. not object). For the regression loss, we use Lreg (ti, t∗i ) = R(ti − t∗i ) where R is the robust loss function (smooth L1) defined in [2]. The term p∗i Lreg means the regression loss is activated only for positive anchors (p∗i = 1) and is disabled otherwise (p∗i = 0). The outputs of the cls and reg layers consist of {pi} and {ti} respectively.\n",
    "The two terms are normalized by Ncls and Nreg and weighted by a balancing parameter λ. In our current implementation (as in the released code), the cls term in Eqn.(1) is normalized by the mini-batch size (i.e., Ncls = 256) and the reg term is normalized by the number of anchor locations (i.e., Nreg ∼ 2, 400). By default we set λ = 10, and thus both cls and reg terms are roughly equally weighted. We show by experiments that the results are insensitive to the values of λ in a wide range (Table 9). We also note that the normalization as above is not required and could be simplified.\n",

    "be thought of as bounding-box regression from an anchor box to a nearby ground-truth box.\n",
    "Nevertheless, our method achieves bounding-box regression by a different manner from previous RoI- based (Region of Interest) methods [1], [2]. In [1], [2], bounding-box regression is performed on features pooled from arbitrarily sized RoIs, and the regression weights are shared by all region sizes. In our formula- tion, the features used for regression are of the same spatial size (3 × 3) on the feature maps. To account for varying sizes, a set of k bounding-box regressors are learned. Each regressor is responsible for one scale and one aspect ratio, and the k regressors do not share weights. As such, it is still possible to predict boxes of various sizes even though the features are of a fixed size/scale, thanks to the design of anchors."

Each mini-batch arises from a single image that contains many positive and negative example anchors. It is possible to optimize for the loss functions of all anchors, but this will bias towards negative samples as they are dominate. Instead, we randomly sample 256 anchors in an image to compute the loss function of a mini-batch, where the sampled positive and negative anchors have a ratio of up to 1:1. If there are fewer than 128 positive samples in an image, we pad the mini-batch with negative ones.\n",

We tune all layers of the ZF net, and conv3 1 and up for the VGG net to conserve memory [2].
