    "\n",
    "Our object detection system, called Faster R-CNN, is composed of two modules. The first module is a deep fully convolutional network that proposes regions, and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector [2] that uses the proposed regions. The entire system is a single, unified network for object detection (Figure 2). Using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with ‘attention’ [31] mechanisms, the RPN module tells the Fast R-CNN module where to look. In Section 3.1 we introduce the designs and properties of the network for region proposal. In Section 3.2 we develop algorithms for training both modules with features shared.\n",

    "A Region Proposal Network (RPN) takes an image (of any size) as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals, each with an objectness score.3 We model this process with a fully convolutional network [7], which we describe in this section. Because our ultimate goal is to share computation with a Fast R-CNN object detection network [2], we assume that both nets share a common set of convolutional layers. In our experiments, we investigate the Zeiler and Fergus model [32] (ZF), which has 5 shareable convolutional layers and the Simonyan and Zisserman model [3] (VGG-16), which has 13 shareable convolutional layers.\n",

    "To generate region proposals, we slide a small network over the convolutional feature map output by the last shared convolutional layer. This small network takes as input an n × n spatial window of the input convolutional feature map. Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional feature (256-d for ZF and 512-d for VGG, with ReLU [33] following). This feature is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers—a box-regression layer (reg) and a box-classification layer (cls). We use n = 3 in this paper, noting that the effective receptive field on the input image is large (171 and 228 pixels for ZF and VGG, respectively). This mini-network is illustrated at a single position in Figure 3 (left). Note that because the mini-network operates in a sliding-window fashion, the fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. This architecture is naturally implemented with an n×n convolutional layer followed by two sibling 1 × 1 convolutional layers (for reg and cls, respectively).\n",

So the reg layer has 4k outputs encoding the coordinates of k boxes, and the cls layer outputs 2k scores that estimate probability of object or not object for each proposal4. The k proposals are parameterized relative to k reference boxes, which we call anchors. An anchor is centered at the sliding window in question, and is associated with a scale and aspect ratio (Figure 3, left). By default we use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yielding k = 9 anchors at each sliding position.

    "Translation-Invariant Anchors\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of our approach is that it is translation invariant, both in terms of the anchors and the functions that compute proposals relative to the anchors. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate and the same function should be able to predict the proposal in either location. This translation-invariant property is guaranteed by our method5. As a comparison, the MultiBox method [27] uses k-means to generate 800 anchors, which are not translation invariant. So MultiBox does not guarantee that the same proposal is generated if an object is translated.\n",

    "我们的方法有一个重要的特征就是与变换无关。无论是anchor还是和anchor相关的计算函数。如果原图片上发生了一个变换，候选也会发生变换使候选区域仍能产生。相比于MultiBox方法，它使用k均值来生成800个锚点，就不具有这种属性。它不能保证在图片发生了变换以后，候选区仍然能给产生。\n",

MultiBox has a (4 + 1) × 800-dimensional fully-connected output layer, whereas our method has a (4 + 2) × 9-dimensional convolutional output layer in the case of k = 9 anchors. As a result, our output layer has 2.8 × 104 parameters (512 × (4 + 2) × 9 for VGG-16), two orders of magnitude fewer than MultiBox’s output layer that has 6.1 × 106 parameters (1536 × (4 + 1) × 800 for GoogleNet [34] in MultiBox [27]). If considering the feature projection layers, our proposal layers still have an order of magnitude fewer parameters than MultiBox6. We expect our method to have less risk of overfitting on small datasets, like PASCAL VOC.\n",

    "这种变换无关属性还减小了模型的尺寸。MultiBox有`(4+1) * 800`维fc层，而我们的方法只有`(4+2) * 9`维的conv层作为输出。因此我们的输出层有 $2.8 \\times 10^4$个参数（`512 * (4 + 2) * 9` VGG的情况下），比MultiBox的输出层少了两个数量级，它有$6.1 \\times 10^6$个参数（`1536 * (4 + 1) * 800` 使用GooleNet的情况）。如果考虑特征映射层的情况下，我们的方法比MultiBox还能下降几个数量级。从而我们期望减小在小数据集上过拟合，例如PASCAL VOC。\n",

    "Multi-Scale Anchors as Regression References\n",
    "\n",
    "Our design of anchors presents a novel scheme for addressing multiple scales (and aspect ratios). As shown in Figure 1, there have been two popular ways for multi-scale predictions. The first way is based on image/feature pyramids, e.g., in DPM [8] and CNN- based methods [9], [1], [2]. The images are resized at multiple scales, and feature maps (HOG [8] or deep convolutional features [9], [1], [2]) are computed for each scale (Figure 1(a)). This way is often useful but is time-consuming. The second way is to use sliding windows of multiple scales (and/or aspect ratios) on the feature maps. For example, in DPM [8], models of different aspect ratios are trained separately using different filter sizes (such as 5×7 and 7×5). If this way is used to address multiple scales, it can be thought of as a “pyramid of filters” (Figure 1(b)). The second way is usually adopted jointly with the first way [8].\n",

Our method classifies and regresses bounding boxes with reference to anchor boxes of multiple scales and aspect ratios.

We show by experiments the effects of this scheme for addressing multiple scales and sizes (Table 8).\n",

Note that a single ground-truth box may assign positive labels to multiple anchors. Usually the second condition is sufficient to determine the positive samples; but we still adopt the first condition for the reason that in some rare cases the second condition may find no positive sample.

In our formula- tion, the features used for regression are of the same spatial size (3 × 3) on the feature maps. To account for varying sizes, a set of k bounding-box regressors are learned. Each regressor is responsible for one scale and one aspect ratio, and the k regressors do not share weights.
