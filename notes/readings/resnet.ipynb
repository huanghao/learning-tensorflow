    "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.\n",

    "1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classification [21, 50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high level features [50] and classifiers in an end-to-end multilayer fashion, and the “levels” of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence [41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results [41, 44, 13, 16] on the challenging ImageNet dataset [36] all exploit “very deep” [41] models, with a depth of sixteen [41] to thirty [16]. Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also greatly benefited from very deep models.\n",
    "\n",
    "深度卷积网络[22,21]在图片分类[21,50,40]上导致了一系列的突破。深度网络以端到端的方式自然地集成了底层/中间层/高层特征[50]还有分类器，而且特征的层次可以通过增加更多的层来丰富（深度）。最近的研究表明[41,44]网络的深度是非常重要的，并且在ImageNet上的最好结果[41,44,13,16]都是深度模型。从16层到30层。许多其他的视觉识别任务[8,12,7,32,27]也从深度模型得到非常多的好处。\n",
    "\n",
    "Driven by the significance of depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers? An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients [1, 9], which hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization [23, 9, 37, 13] and intermediate normalization layers [16], which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation [22].\n",
    "\n",
    "由于深度的增加，一个问题就产生了：学习更好的网路是否和叠加更多的层一样容易？回答这个问题的第一个障碍是臭名昭著的梯度消失/爆炸[1,9]，它从一开始就阻碍了收敛。但是这个问题已经极大低被初始化中的标准化[23,9,37,13]和中间层的标准化[16]解决了，使得几十层的网络通过反向传递和随机梯度下降[22]能够开始收敛。\n",
    "\n",
    "When deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error, as reported in [11, 42] and thoroughly verified by our experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "当深度网路开始收敛，一个降级的问题出现了：网络深度增加了，准确率饱和了（这可能并不奇怪）然后迅速下降。意外的是，这种退化并不是由过拟合引起的，在一个合适的深度模型中增加更多的层会导致更高的训练误差，[11,42]提到了这些，并且被我们的试验全面的验证了。图1是一个典型的例子。\n",

    "图1：训练误差（左）和测试误差（右）在CIFAR-10上，20层和56层的简单网络。较深的网络有很大的训练和测试误差。图4显示了在ImageNet上的相同的现象。\n",
    "\n",
    "The degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not all systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model. The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that our current solvers on hand are unable to find solutions that are comparably good or better than the constructed solution (or unable to do so in feasible time).\n",
    "\n",
    "这种退化（训练准确率）表明不是所有的系统都能同样简单地优化。我们来考虑一个浅网络结构和一个通过添加更多层的深网络。有一种方式来构造更深的模型：新增加的层是一对一的映射，其它层从已经训练的浅网络拷贝而来。这种构造方法表明一个深网络不应该比对应的浅网络有更高的训练误差。但是试验表明，我们目前的学习方案比不上这种构造方法（或者没有足够的时间）。\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of F (x) := H(x) − x. The original mapping is recast into F(x)+x. We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "在这篇论文中，我们引入一种深度残差学习框架来解决这个退化问题。\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation of F (x) + x can be realized by feedforward neural networks with “shortcut connections” (Fig. 2). Shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] are those skipping one or more layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity. The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries (e.g., Caffe [19]) without modifying the solvers.\n",

    "We present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet [36] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our method. We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets are easy to optimize, but the counterpart “plain” nets (that simply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the depth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy accuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks.\n",

    "On the ImageNet classification dataset [36], we obtain excellent results by extremely deep residual nets. Our 152layer residual net is the deepest network ever presented on ImageNet, while still having lower complexity than VGG nets [41]. Our ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the ImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition. The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that the residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that it is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems.\n",

    "Residual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD [18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors with respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be formulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both of them are powerful shallow representations for image retrieval and classification [4, 48]. For vector quantization, encoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effective than encoding original vectors.\n",

    "In low-level vision and computer graphics, for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used Multigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subproblems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is responsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a finer scale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis preconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that represent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown [3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than standard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the solutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation or preconditioning can simplify the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcut Connections. Practices and theories that lead to shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long time. An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43] present shortcut connections with gating functions [15]. These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g., over 100 layers).\n"

    "Let us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with x denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions2, then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e., H(x) − x (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions). So rather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function F(x) := H(x) − x. The original function thus becomes F(x)+x. Although both forms should be able to asymptotically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized), the ease of learning might be different.\n",

    "This reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive phenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As we discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should have training error no greater than its shallower counterpart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings by multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning reformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers may simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear layers toward zero to approach identity mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are optimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the problem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity mapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the solver to find the perturbations with reference to an identity mapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show by experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in general have small responses, suggesting that identity mappings provide reasonable preconditioning.\n",

The operation F + x is performed by a shortcut connection and element-wise addition. We adopt the second nonlinearity after the addition (i.e., σ(y), see Fig. 2).\n",

    "Plain Network. Our plain baselines (Fig. 3, middle) are mainly inspired by the philosophy of VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3, left). The convolutional layers mostly have 3×3 filters and follow two simple design rules: (i) for the same output feature map size, the layers have the same number of filters; and (ii) if the feature map size is halved, the number of filters is doubled so as to preserve the time complexity per layer. We perform downsampling directly by convolutional layers that have a stride of 2. The network ends with a global average pooling layer and a 1000-way fully-connected layer with softmax. The total number of weighted layers is 34 in Fig. 3 (middle).\n",

A 224×224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its horizontal flip, with the per-pixel mean subtracted [21]. The standard color augmentation in [21] is used. We adopt batch normalization (BN) [16] right after each convolution and before activation, following [16]. We initialize the weights as in [13] and train all plain/residual nets from scratch. We use SGD with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus, and the models are trained for up to 60 × 104 iterations.
