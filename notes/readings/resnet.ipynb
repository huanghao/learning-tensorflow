    "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.\n",

    "1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classification [21, 50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high level features [50] and classifiers in an end-to-end multilayer fashion, and the “levels” of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence [41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results [41, 44, 13, 16] on the challenging ImageNet dataset [36] all exploit “very deep” [41] models, with a depth of sixteen [41] to thirty [16]. Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also greatly benefited from very deep models.\n",
    "\n",
    "深度卷积网络[22,21]在图片分类[21,50,40]上导致了一系列的突破。深度网络以端到端的方式自然地集成了底层/中间层/高层特征[50]还有分类器，而且特征的层次可以通过增加更多的层来丰富（深度）。最近的研究表明[41,44]网络的深度是非常重要的，并且在ImageNet上的最好结果[41,44,13,16]都是深度模型。从16层到30层。许多其他的视觉识别任务[8,12,7,32,27]也从深度模型得到非常多的好处。\n",
    "\n",
    "Driven by the significance of depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers? An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients [1, 9], which hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization [23, 9, 37, 13] and intermediate normalization layers [16], which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation [22].\n",
    "\n",
    "由于深度的增加，一个问题就产生了：训练更好的网路是否和叠加更多的层一样容易？回答这个问题的第一个障碍是臭名昭著的梯度消失/爆炸[1,9]，它从一开始就阻碍了收敛。但是这个问题已经极大低被初始化中的标准化[23,9,37,13]和中间层的标准化[16]解决了，使得几十层的网络通过反向传递和随机梯度下降[22]能够开始收敛。\n",
    "\n",
    "When deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error, as reported in [11, 42] and thoroughly verified by our experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "当深度网路开始收敛，一个退化问题出现了：网络深度增加了，准确率饱和了（这可能并不奇怪）然后迅速下降。意外的是，这种退化并不是由过拟合引起的，在一个合适的深度模型中增加更多的层会导致更高的训练误差，[11,42]提到了这些，并且被我们的试验全面的验证了。图1是一个典型的例子。\n",

    "图1：训练误差（左）和测试误差（右）在CIFAR-10上，20层和56层的简单网络。较深的网络有很大的训练和测试误差。图4显示了在ImageNet上的相同的现象。\n",
    "\n",
    "The degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not all systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model. The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that our current solvers on hand are unable to find solutions that are comparably good or better than the constructed solution (or unable to do so in feasible time).\n",
    "\n",
    "这种训练准确率的退化表明不是所有的系统都能同样简单地优化。我们来考虑一个浅网络结构和一个在它上添加层的深网络。用一种方式来构造更深的模型：新增加的层是一对一的映射，其它层从已经训练的浅网络拷贝而来。这种构造方法表明一个深网络不应该比对应的浅网络有更高的训练误差。但是试验表明，我们目前的学习方案比不上这种构造方法（或者没有足够的时间）。\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of F (x) := H(x) − x. The original mapping is recast into F(x)+x. We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "在这篇论文中，我们引入一种深度残差学习框架来解决这个退化问题。不同于让每个层直接来拟合底层的映射，我们显式的让这些层拟合一个残差映射。形式上，底层映射用H(x)指代，我们让堆叠的非线性层来拟合另一个映射F(x) := H(x) - x。原来的映射就变成了 F(x) + x。我们假设这个残差映射比原映射要更容易优化。极端情况下，如果原映射是identity，把残差变成0，比直接用这些层来拟合这个identity映射要容易。\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation of F (x) + x can be realized by feedforward neural networks with “shortcut connections” (Fig. 2). Shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] are those skipping one or more layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity. The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries (e.g., Caffe [19]) without modifying the solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "公式 F(x) + x 可以通过前向网络的“短路连接”来实现（图2）。短路连接[2,34,49]跳过了一个或多个层。在我们这里，短路连接只是简单的做恒等的映射，它们的输出被添加到堆叠层的输出上（图2）。恒等短路连接每天增加新的参数，也没有额外的计算复杂度。整个网络依然可以使用端到端的反向传递来训练，通过一些公共库在不改变优化器的情况下可以很简单地被实现。\n",

We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets are easy to optimize, but the counterpart “plain” nets (that simply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the depth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy accuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks.\n",

Our ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the ImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition. The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that the residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that it is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems.\n",

    "Residual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD [18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors with respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be formulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both of them are powerful shallow representations for image retrieval and classification [4, 48]. For vector quantization, encoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effective than encoding original vectors.\n",

    "In low-level vision and computer graphics, for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used Multigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subproblems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is responsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a finer scale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis preconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that represent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown [3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than standard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the solutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation or preconditioning can simplify the optimization.\n",

    "在底层视觉和计算机图形学中，为了求解PDE（偏微分方程），Multigrid方法被广泛使用来把系统分成多个尺度的子问题，而每个子问题负责在较粗和较细的尺度上解决残差问题。Multigrid的替代方法是层次基础预处理，它依赖于两个尺度之间的残差向量的变量表达。[3,45,46]已经证明这些优化方法比不考虑残差属性的方法收敛要迅速得多。这些方法都说明一种好的重新表达和预处理可以简化优化问题。\n",

    "Shortcut Connections. Practices and theories that lead to shortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long time. An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network input to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few intermediate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classifiers for addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers of [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer responses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by shortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is composed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches.\n",

    "Concurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43] present shortcut connections with gating functions [15]. These gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in contrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free. When a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the layers in highway networks represent non-residual functions. On the contrary, our formulation always learns residual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed, and all information is always passed through, with additional residual functions to be learned. In addition, highway networks have not demonstrated accuracy gains with extremely increased depth (e.g., over 100 layers).\n",

    "Let us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with x denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions2, then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e., H(x) − x (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions). So rather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function F(x) := H(x) − x. The original function thus becomes F(x)+x. Although both forms should be able to asymptotically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized), the ease of learning might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们假设通过几个叠加的层（不需要是整个网络）来拟合H(x)映射，x 表示这些层的第一个输入。如果假设多个非线性层可以渐进地逼近复杂的函数，那么也就是说它们同样可以渐进地逼近残差函数，也就是，H(x) - x（假设输入和输出维度相同）。我们显式地让这些层来逼近一个残差函数：F(x) := H(x) - x，而不是原函数H(x)。原函数就变成了F(x) + x。尽量两种形式都被逼近，但是学习的难易度是不同的。\n",

    "This reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive phenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As we discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should have training error no greater than its shallower counterpart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings by multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning reformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers may simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear layers toward zero to approach identity mappings.\n",

    "这个变形是因为反直觉的退化现象而提出的（图1左）。在介绍部分讨论过，如果新添加的层可以被组织成恒等映射，那么一个更深的模型的训练误差就不会比对应的浅模型要大。退化现象显示用多个非线性层逼近恒等映射，优化器有困难。在残差学习的形式中，如果最优的映射是恒等，优化器简单的把多个线性层的权重都设置成0，就可以来逼近恒等映射。\n",
    "\n",
    "In real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are optimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the problem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity mapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the solver to find the perturbations with reference to an identity mapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show by experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in general have small responses, suggesting that identity mappings provide reasonable preconditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "在实际中，最优的目标是恒等映射这种情况不太可能，但是我们的变形有利于预先解决这个问题。如果最优化目标函数比0更近似于恒等映射，对于优化器，找到恒等映射的扰动，比把这个函数作为一个新函数，要容易一些（不知道说了些啥。。。）。通过实验（图7）表明，学习到的残差函数一般来说响应比较小，这说明恒等映射提供了合理的预处理。\n",

These plain networks are trained with BN [16], which ensures forward propagated signals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the backward propagated gradients exhibit healthy norms with BN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In fact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve competitive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works to some extent. We conjecture that the deep plain nets may have exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the reducing of the training error3.

We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are particularly important for not increasing the complexity of the bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.\n",
